        "Stack",
        "Tree",
        "Graph"

      "explanation": "A queue follows the FIFO principle where the element inserted first is removed first. Stack follows LIFO, while trees and graphs do not enforce any such order."

        "First Normal Form",
        "Second Normal Form",
        "Boyce-Codd Normal Form"

        "30",
        "20",
        "15"
      ],
      "explanation": "According to operator precedence, multiplication is performed before addition. So 10 * 2 = 20, then 5 + 20 = 25."

        "Preorder traversal",
        "Inorder traversal",
